pyrtlsdr-peakfinder
==============

The quickest, dirtiest scanner imaginable to spit out frequencies on which signal peaks are detected for RTL-SDR radios. It is probably not very efficient, but it does work. For my hardware. Good luck.

Usage: `peakfinder.py 88.0 110.0` (in megahertz)

The values in the script were empirically determined and you should feel free to adjust them. Reported frequencies may lean slightly right of the signal's center.
